Floyd’s triangle
Floyd’s triangle, named after Robert Floyd, is a right angled triangle which is made up using natural numbers. It start from 1 and consecutively selects the next greater number in the sequence.

In the Floyd’s triangle, there are n integers in the nth row and total of (n(n+1))/2 integer in the rows.
